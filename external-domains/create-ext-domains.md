Once the domain is assigned to a Remote Worker Pool, the Groups, Organizational Units and Attributes should be synchronized. Synchronization can be starting by managing the External Domain. Each section (Domain Groups, Domain Organizational Units, and Domain Attributes) will have a synchronization button. Click to start the sync. Depending on the size of the domain, it may take a 1 to 15 minutes to complete.
