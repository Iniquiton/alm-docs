## Define Role Permissions

After adding the new Role, you will see the details and permissions page for the new role where you can define or adjust permissions.

To find this page for any Role, navigate to **Roles** in the navigation pane and click on the name of the Role you want to adjust, then click the **Manage Role** button to see the details and permissions for the Role.

Adjust the Permissions by clicking any of the **CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE**, or **MANAGE** toggle boxes corresponding to the **Features** listed that you want to assign to this Role. Unchecking a box will remove the permission from this Role.

**Note:** All changes made to these permissions will automatically save. Deleting new objects is not currently supported, but any added object can be disabled in the Alpha Build.
