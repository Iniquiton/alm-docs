# Roles

Thycotic ALM includes four out-of-the-box User Roles:

* **Provision Requester:** Permission to request a new account
* **Provision Approver:** Permission to approve requests
* **System Administrator:** Permission to authorize all role types, create workflow template, set up remote workers, Active Directory integration and Secret Server integration
* **Workflow Manager:** Permission to approve workflows and set up the workflow approval steps

The first user that logs into ALM is assigned the **System Administrator** Role and can create users, assign Role types, and create Workflow Templates to start the setup process.
