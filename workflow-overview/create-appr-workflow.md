## Create an Approval Workflow

User Roles Engaged:

* System Administrator
* Workflow Manager

Setting up the type of accounts that can be created and the approval system required before an account is approved for creation are two sides of the workflow creation process. These are the steps that occur during this administrative process:

* The System Administrator sets up the Provisioning environment by creating users, assigning roles to users, and setting up integrations and domain connections. The System Administrator also creates workflow templates that are submitted for approval.
* The Workflow Manager reviews the Workflow Template submission and creates an Approval system for the request, deciding how many people should be required to sign off on the type of account being requested, and the order in which those approvals will take place. Once this Approval Workflow is created, the Workflow Manager submits this workflow back to the System Administrator for another approval.
* After reviewing the suggested edits and Approval Workflow submitted by the Workflow Manager, the System Administrator will publish this Workflow and enable it for use. Now accounts will be able to be requested and approved through this template.
