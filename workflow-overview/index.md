# Workflow Overview

Provisioning at its most basic provides a system through which a variety of users can request new accounts or approve the requests for new accounts. The approval process can be tailored to fit granular workflows so that privileged accounts will not be created without the oversight of appropriate authorities, and account requests can be defined according to organizational policies.

Using the four Out-of-the-Box user Roles, there are two types of Workflows that happen among different users of Provisioning Server:

* Workflow Template and Approval Workflow Creation Process
* Account Request and Approval Workflow
