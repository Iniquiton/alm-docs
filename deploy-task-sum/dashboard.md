## Dashboard

Navigate to your organization’s ALM URL. Click “Sign In” and you will be redirected to Thycotic One for authentication.

If you do not have an account with Thycotic One, create a new account. The email address must match the email address that was provided during the Alpha signup.

After you authenticate, Thycotic One will display the ALM Dashboard.

The Alpha Build has a blank Dashboard with a left-hand navigation pane.
