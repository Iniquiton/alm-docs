# Overview

Account Lifecycle Manager (ALM) centralizes account provisioning and lifecycle management, increasing the clarity of your network view and improving overall confidence in network security.

By governing each aspect of account provisioning, ALM automates compliance with your standards for account naming, attribute assignment, group membership, and expiration settings—curtailing the account sprawl and inconsistency afflicting many networks.

Because ALM integrates with Secret Server, accounts provisioned using ALM appear in the Secret Server vault. Expiring accounts can be decommissioned, and their secrets deactivated.
