## Manage Integrations

From the Manage Integration page you can **Edit** the Account Active Directory Domain name, **Enable/Disable** the integration and **Synchronizing** Folders and Templates.

Upon initial setup, Folder and Templates must be synchronized. This can be performed by clicking the Synchronize buttons. The synchronization will occur in the background and may take a few minutes to complete.
